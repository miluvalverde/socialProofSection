- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For fonts

### What I learned

In this porject I applied my basic HTML and CSS knowledge such as basic HTML structure, class, id, flex-box, grid, pseudo-class, transition, media queries and sass/scss.

I would like to continue focusing on grid layout, animations and transitions, these are concepts that I'm not 
completely comfortable with.
